## Getting Started

### Backend Setup (Java Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-backend-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Set environment variables (if required):

   - `DB_URL`: MySQL connection URL
   - `DB_USERNAME`: Database username
   - `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password
   - `PORT`: Port number for the backend

4. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:8080` (or the specified port).

### Frontend Setup (React with Vite)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd <your-frontend-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).
